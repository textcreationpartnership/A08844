            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, and beloued in the Lord, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many friuolous and ſlanderous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which our aduerſaries the Papiſts lay vpon our Religion, this is none of the meaneſt, nor vnuſualleſt, that wee cannot be the true Church, which is as a Cittie at vnitie in it ſelfe, becauſe of the manifould diſſentions &amp; diuiſions which are nouriſhed amongſt vs, for they thus caſt in our teeth, that the Doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> was no ſooner bred, &amp; borne, but it deuided it ſelfe like a Hidra into many heads: <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Anabaptiſts, Libertines, Swelckfeldians, Arians, &amp;c.</hi> which to be a mere calumniation of theirs, deuiſed as many other things elſe by them to the diſcredit of our religion, may appeate by many reaſons, three or foure whereof I will onely propound to thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different cenſure in this ſhort Epiſtle. Firſt therefore their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnie doth appeare in that diuerſe of thoſe ſects which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as ſpringing from <hi>Luthers</hi> roote, are none of ours, neither euer were of vs. We abhorre &amp; deteſt them as much, if not more then they themſelues. They ſprung from the Diuel, and not from <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther:</hi> to wit the <hi>Anabaptiſts, Libertines, Swenckfeldians</hi> and <hi>Arians:</hi> againſt whom both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expreſſe treatiſes, that the world may know how farre they were from approuing their damned errors, and how our aduerſaries make no conſcience of open lying and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our religion and perſons, ſo that they may diſcredit vs &amp; aduantage themſelues thereby. Secondly if vnity in all things be a certaine marke of the true Church, and diuiſion a marke of the falſe Church, then was there neuer true Church in the world, for there was neuer any yet in the perfect vnitie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:14431:4"/>that in it there were not many ſects and diuiſions. <hi>Irenaeus an excellent</hi> and holy father, <hi>telleth vs as much</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>tanquam ex nucleo nucis oliuae naſcitur oleaſter: ſic ex medio eccleſiae extiterunt hereſes:</hi> that is, as from the kernell of the ſweete Oliue ſpringeth the wilde: ſo out of the midſt of the Church ſpringeth hereſies. Thus was it in the Church of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Theſſalonica</hi> and the reſt to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtles, where there were many ſects and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, and many exorbitant opinions touching things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: the Lords ſupper, and the reſurrection of the body, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the ſecond comming of the Lord, &amp;c. Likewiſe after and in the Apoſtles times, how the primatiue Church was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with Heritikes, the Simonians, the Nicolaitans, the Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts, the Cerinthonians and ſuch like. Who knoweth not the like may be ſhowne of all ages ſucceſſiuely? Neither was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuch a vnity to be found in any Church vpon earth, that there were no hereſies, nor oppoſition of opinion lurking therein. Thirdly if this be a iuſt exception againſt vs, then much more may it take hould of them, whoſe diuiſions are both more in number and weightier in conſequent then ours are, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, they cannot agree whether the Pope can erre in the faith or no: nor whether the counſell be aboue the Pope: or the Pope aboue the Counſell: nor whether a man may be certaine of his ſtanding in the ſtate of grace or no. All matters of great moment. Againe it is notoriouſly knowne to all men, how the Ieſuites and ſecular Prieſts differ in iudgement about the Popes coactiue power in the temporall affaires of Princes: and how of elder yeares their diuinitie was diuided into three families, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, Scotiſts, Occamiſts: Thomas</hi> againſt <hi>Scot,</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Occam</hi> againſt both. And againe who knoweth not, how the Romiſh doctors differ in iudgement about the vow of ſingle life, the lent faſt, &amp; auricular confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whether theſe be of diuine institution or eccleſiaſticall onely, as alſo about mariage after diuors, originall ſinne, and the conception of the Virgin Mary: about all theſe matters there is ſuch contention amongſt them, and oftentimes with ſuch bitterneſſe, that they
<pb facs="tcp:14431:4"/>would euen ſeeme to deuour one another. Laſtly it is a wonder to ſee with how many idle controuerſies their doctrine of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation is enwrapped, one houlding this, another that, &amp; ſcarce two of them agreeing all things, the verſe is well knowne which I ſhall heere ſet downe: <hi>Corpore de Chriſti lis eſt, de ſanguine lis eſt: Lis eſt de modo, non habitura modum.</hi> If varietie of opinions now marre the forme of a Church, then is their Church vtterly ſpoyled. and put out of faſhion, rather then ours, wherein for one controuerſie with vs, there are tenne with them (I dare bouldly auouch) and thoſe of no trifles but of main points of their Religion. Laſtly if we conſider aright the diuiſions that are in our Church betwixt the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> we ſhall eaſely perceaue that they are both few in quantitie and in qualitie, ſuch as ouerthrow no fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall article of the faith: And this to be ſo, this ſhort treatiſe will plainely and briefely diſcouer vnto thee, if thou pleaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow but an houre or two reading vpon it.</p>
            <p>The Authors thereof are Germanes, the tranſlator a man not profeſſing ſchollerſhip, but exerciſed in traficke of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and therefore thou in wiſedome wilt accept his wholeſome bunch of Rheniſh grapes, though clad with a plain and eaſie gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made of homeſpun thred. I am perſwaded that his zeale to Gods Church, and his loue to the peace of Zion moued him to vndertake this taſke, and in my iudgement this his good intent cannot but in ſome meaſure take ſome good effect, for this ſhort tract may ſerue thee for three excellent purpoſes: Firſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the malice of our Romiſh aduerſaries, who by muſtering vp our diuiſions, would faine proue vs to haue no veritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, becauſe we haue no vnitie: whereas our differences are here made manifeſt to be not many in number, nor of anie great moment, that is ſuch as concerne the wals and windowes of our faith, but not the foundation. Secondly thou maiſt alſo here take view what the maine differences are betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and the <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> that thou maiſt be able to iudge how the vnitie of faith is not broken betwixt them, and that both ioine together in the ſeruice of one Chriſt, and againſt his
<pb facs="tcp:14431:5"/>great enemie Antichriſt. And Laſtly it may ſerue alſo, as a meanes to calm the heat of the moderne quarrels in our Church, which haue beene purſued on both partes, with too too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſpirit: for here both ſides may learne this wholeſome and ſhort leſſon, that ſeeing they builde vpon one foundation, therefore though they meete not in opinion, yet they would meete in brotherly loue: and laying aſide all rancour and violent cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ioine their forces againſt the common aduerſarie. And this is the principall drift of this ſhort diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Now the God of peace ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctiſie vs al throughout both in body, ſoule and ſpirit, that they may bee kept blameleſſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Ieſus: and giue vs grace that wee may hould faſt the vnity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>

            <head>A FAITHFVLL ADMONITION of the PFALTZGRAVES <hi>Churches,</hi> To all other Proteſtant Churches <hi>in</hi> DVCHLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued brethren, all you that call vpon the name of the Lord Ieſus with vs, and deſire to be ſaued by his death and bloodſhedding, as well as we; you know how our true Lord and Sauiour ſo heartily councelled vs to peace,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.34.35. Ioh. 17.11.21.</note> And how feruently hee commanded at his departure out of this world, that wee ſhould agree one with another: that ſo, the whole world might know that hee was ſent of God.</p>
            <p>You know alſo, how Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.17. 1. Cor. 12.12.13.14.</note> that wee who beleeue in Chriſt, are all together one body, and ſhould loue together as members of one body, and one beare with the infirmities of another: And he that doth not ſo,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.16.</note> but hath delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, hee is no true member of the Church of God. For, the congregation of God hath no pleaſure in contention.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:14431:6"/>
            <p> How come we then to it, (Louing brethren) that wee haue now contended together ſo many yeares with ſuch bitterneſſe, which well beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not the very heathen; and that, for ſuch queſtions, without the knowledge whereof, a man may well bee ſaued? It being ſo, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, are ſince dead, on both ſides, who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood neither the one nor the others meaning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and yet are neuertheleſſe ſaued, being dead in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What intend we then, by ſo ſhameful a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about ſuch queſtions, whereon ſaluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not? One thinketh that the bread is to be broken at the Supper: the other, that it may well be left vnbroken. How many thouſand people are ſaued, who haue eaten the bread broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? How many thouſand people are ſaued alſo, who haue eaten the bread at the Supper vnbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? Is that then ſuch a matter, for which one ſhould condemne an other ſo vnchriſtianly: as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the <hi>Wittenbergers</hi> condemned vs, and as now the <hi>Darmſtatters</hi> condemne vs anew.</p>
            <p>True it is, the <hi>Darmſtatters</hi> and <hi>Wittenbergers,</hi> accuſe vs, as if wee had begun ſuch condemning, and had outlawed to Hell, all ſuch, as doe not breake the bread at the Supper.</p>
            <p>But, the Lord knowes it, that they doe vs wrong.</p>
            <p>They would indeed inforce it from this: for that we hold the breaking of bread for needfull.</p>
            <p>Now it is moſt certaine, wee hold the breaking of bread as needfull: for we take it, that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14431:6"/>it ſo to bee: to accompliſh his commaund, is then needfull. And therefore we beleeue, that they do erre, who hold the breaking of bread for a free indifferent thing, which one, may as wel leaue vndone, as done. But that wee ſhould condemne any man for ſuch an error, that wil neuer be found in any of our writings, but almoſt euery where the very contrary is holden by vs in this matter.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beza writ at leaſt 30 yeares agone, that one who dwelt in ſuch a place where the breaking of bread were not in vſe, was not therefore to refraine the Supper. For although it be an errour to leaue the bread vnbroken, yet is it not ſuch an errour, for which a man ſhould be houlden a heathen: which a man doth when he refuſeth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with him that houldeth the contrary. But it is ſuch an errour, which a man for chriſtian loue ſake, muſt beare withal in them that commit it, as with many more others alſo.</p>
            <p>The like alſo writes Doct. <hi>Parens</hi> in his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of breaking bread, and ſaith: <hi>that we do not ſay nor hold, that they that breake not the bread at the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, haue no ſupper of Chriſt at all, as ſome accuſe vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner hath bene diuers times ſhewed in the three writings penned by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Pfaltzgraues Churches, eight yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, in defence of the Anholts reformation, and ſet againſt the writings of complaint of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of Wittinberge, eſpecially in the preface vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the anſwere of the Wittenbergers meſſage of the Ambergs <hi>information, amongst which theſe words
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14431:7"/>are read, therefore wee intreat all honeſt Chriſtians to whom this writing ſhall come to bee read, that they would certainly hould, that though wee maintaine the opinion of our Churches, with befitting zeale, yet doe we not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any ſort condemne other Churches which therein hold not with vs,</hi> namely concerning the breaking of bread, putting away of Images, and other <hi>the like queſtions, which are handled in theſe writings. But we acknowledge all thoſe for the children of God, and for brethren in Chriſt Ieſus, who deſire to be ſaued onely by faith in Chriſt, and with ſuch a faith practiſe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and blameleſſe life, though they doe not practiſe the very ſame Ceremonies which we conſtantly hold that God hath commanded to be practiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, louing brethren, what hath beene euer our opinion and conſtruction concerning this matter, and is now: to wit that we condemne no man for leauing the bread vnbroken, though wee hould ſuch vnbreaking for a thing vniuſt.</p>
            <p>If wee then condemne no man that leaueth the bread at the ſupper vnbroken, though wee hould ſuch vnbreaking to be vnlawfull, wherefore ſhall we be condemned, for that we hould the breaking thereof at the ſupper, whereas euery man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the breaking thereof at the ſupper is vnlawfull, it beeing ſo, that Chriſt himſelfe brake the bread at his laſt ſupper.</p>
            <p>That therefore is ſtrained too farre, that wee ſhould be condemned becauſe we hould the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread for needfull, it beeing but a free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different thing, as if all men muſt bee damned that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14431:7"/>hold an indifferent thing for needfull.</p>
            <p>But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth much other waies. <hi>One</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beleeu's he may eat of all things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.2.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; another which is weake eateth hearbs, let not him that eateth deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe him that eateth not: and let not him which eateth not Iudge him that eateth, for God hath receiued him Who art thou that condemneſt an other mans ſeruant? hee ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or falleth to his owne maſter: yea he ſhall be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for God is able to make him ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> own words. Wherin hee teacheth that though one hould an indifferent thing needful, yet he ſhould not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for it.</p>
            <p>But it is yet diſputable, whether the breaking of bread be an indifferent thing or not. Wee haue ſhewed our reaſons, in the afore named three wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and many others of our bookes, wherfore we hold not that the bread-breaking is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, of which our reaſons euery man may iudge as his conſcience moueth. But, admit that bread-breaking were an indifferent thing, and that we erred therein, in holding it for needfull, yet were it not ſuch an errour, for which wee ſhould be condemned as heathens, and be ſhut out of the fellowſhip of the Euangelicall Churches.</p>
            <p>They alledge againſt vs the example of <hi>Paul:</hi> who elſe could well haue endured the circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but when it was ſtood upon as needfull: hee ſaith, that no man ſhould enforce it vpon him: that he loſe not Chriſt. Euen ſo ſay the Wittenberg. &amp; Di Vietor of Sieſſen, that if men hould the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread for indifferent, then they could well
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14431:8"/>let it paſſe, but when it is ſtood vpon as needfull, then ought euery man iuſtly to ſet himſelfe againſt it. For anſwere: we muſt know that Circumciſion was neuer an indifferent thing, but was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the old teſtament. But in the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and in the time of <hi>Paul,</hi> God would haue it laide downe with honour, and from that time to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a forbidden Ceremony. Therefore the example of Circumciſion hath no reference to the queſtion of indifferent things. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the rule which <hi>Paul</hi> giueth of indifferent things vncaſt downe with this example. Which rule is, as aforeſaid, that a man ſhould not therfore condemne another, though he ſhould erre in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an indifferent thing, for needfull.</p>
            <p>It is further obiected, that neuertheleſſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty is broken, when indifferent things are eſteemed needfull. But this obiection is alſo of no force.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.33.</note> For Chriſtian freedome brings not that with it, that in indifferent things, euery man may doe what he will, Elſe there <hi>would bee no order held in the Church of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not. Antes fol. 6.2.</note> 
               <hi>But, it ſtandeth free for euery ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate (with helpe of the miniſtery) to take order as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry country beſt fits for their furtherance, as the Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergers themſelues confeſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt it is complained of, how fearefully the common man taketh offence at the breaking of bread, but wee cannot beleeue that any where a Chriſtian man is offended at breaking of bread, for euery man knoweth that Chriſt himſelfe brake the bread <hi>at the ſupper, as appeareth by the cleare words:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14431:8"/>Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the night that hee was betrayed tooke bread and when hee had giuen thanks hee brake it.</hi> How is it then poſſible for any man to bee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at breaking of bread?</p>
            <p>No man ſure will take offence at that which Chriſt himſelfe hath done. In ſomme, let them ſeeke what they can: they cannot find the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to controle the practiſe of breaking of bread. Yet muſt we therefore bee againe condemned of the Darmſtatters, and put into the <hi>number of thoſe of whom it is written:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.12.</note> 
               <hi>Would God they were euen cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not ſo louing brethren, but would God wee were all honeſt: and that the one would beare with the other with patience, as Chriſt hath giuen vs a commandement, that were much better <hi>then that wee deſire one another to be cut off.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 13.35.</note> 
               <hi>By this ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, ſaith Chriſt,</hi> not if you deſire <hi>to deſtroy</hi> each other: <hi>but if you loue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> Bleſſed bee God wee are no ſuch folke as they were of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Wold to God they were euen cut off. Wee deſire not to bring in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Leuiticall ceremonies, and to be thereby iuſt and ſaued before the Lord, and ſo make the grace of Chriſt of no effect: as they did of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, would to God they were cut off, wee put our confidence onely and ſoly in Chriſt Ieſus, and deſire not otherwiſe to be made iuſt and ſaued before God, then through faith in him, of ſuch people did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, would to God they were cut off: though they ſhould yet faile in ſome
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14431:9"/>things:<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15. Rom. 14.1.13.</note> 
               <hi>But if any be otherwaies minded, the Lord ſhall manifeſt the ſame vnto him. Alſo, him that is weake in the faith, receiue vnto you, but not for controuerſies of diſputations. Alſo, let vs not iudge one another any more; but vſe iudgement rather in this, that no man put an occaſion to fall, or a ſtumbling-blocke before his brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may well be, that we faile in ſomething, for we are men: but conſider, louing brethren, that you are alſo men, and ſo may faile euen as well as other men.</p>
            <p>Where now yee condemne vs, and wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you, <hi>what will be the end thereof?</hi> not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>then that we ſhall be both deuoured.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.14.15.</note> As it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly befell to the Eaſterne Churches, when they would not ceaſe to condemne each other.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts plot about it day and night, how they may deſtroy and conſume vs, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When we now our ſelues ſhall deſire the one to deuoure the other, what ſhall wee otherwaies accompliſh, then that wee deliuer the Papiſts the ſword into their hands, wherewith to deſtroy vs all? But and if we agreed, and held together, the Pope with all his adherents would be driuen to conſider well with himſelfe, whether hee would take vs in hand, or not. But if we be ſeparated from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it will be no hard matter vnto him to deuoure one of vs after the other.</p>
            <p>Yea indeed, that is the very matter, out of which the Papiſts ground their ſure hopes, that they will ſhortly againe be maſters of all Duchland. For ſay
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14431:9"/>they, the Proteſtants are ſeperated,<note place="margin">Iohn Paul Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck in Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtico, futuri ſtatus Eccleſiae. Luk. 11.17.</note> and therefore their building cannot hold. This rekoning the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues make, and in truth it is an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible rule, for Chriſt faith himſelfe, <hi>Euery kingdome deuided againſt it ſelfe ſhall be deſolate: and a houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided againſt a houſe falleth.</hi> If we will not then ceaſe one to contend with the other, then cannot the Papiſts reckoning faile them, but we muſt needs be made deſolate.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the greateſt part amongſt thoſe that call themſelues Lutheranes, ſuffer themſelues to be perſwaded, that the blood-thirſty drifts of the Papiſts tende onely againſt thoſe whom ſome call Caluiniſts. As for themſelues, there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all, for the Caluiniſts (who hould but naked tokens in the Sacraments) as they falſely accuſe them, are not comprehended in the contract of the peace for Religion. But they themſelues are out of all doubt comprehended in that religious peace, and therefore the Pope dare not medle with them, yes indeed, no more then the Wolfe dare lay hould on the Sheep that is branded.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts write, and it is yet vnrecalled, that they are not bound to hould that religious peace,<note place="margin">Iohn Paul Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck in Pro. ſut. ſta. Eccle. pag. 326.</note> no not with the Lutheranes. For firſt, it was forced from the Emperour by conſtraint, beſides that, it was meant onely for a time, which is now expired, ſince the publiſhing of the decrees and explication of the Counſell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and laſt of all, the Pope neuer confirming the ſame, therfore it neuer ſtood in any force indeed. As alſo in like manner, euery
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14431:10"/>yeare, in the day of the Lords Supper, in Rome, all they that are called Lutheranes, as well as they that are called Caluiniſts, are in like manner acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and condemned for Hereticks, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and pronounced to be out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of Chriſt. Therefore they are ſimple people, that put any truſt in this Religious peace.</p>
            <p>Our agreement and bond, next vnto God, is a right religious peace indeed, and had not iuditious Polititians of late hindered it at ſeuerall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when it was ſought for, namely, by kindling a breach amongſt the Proteſtant Princes, by ſome of the contentious Diuines, it would long ſince haue beene ſeene, what had beene the force of a Religious peace.</p>
            <p>When the Papiſts were maſters of <hi>Aken,</hi> what helped the Lutherans their Religious peace? they muſt euen as well depart the Citie, as the Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</p>
            <p>And what manner of people were they which were perſecuted and baniſhed many yeares in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, Carinthia, Stiria,</hi> alſo in <hi>Frankenlands,</hi> and the Abbey of <hi>Fulda,</hi> were they not Lutherans?</p>
            <p>In ſumme, the Pope loueth <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> alike, euen the one as well as the other, and if he could this day deſtroy them both, he would not tarry till to morow.</p>
            <p>Therefore beloued brethren, conſider what we are to do. The Heathen were formerly of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had a common enemy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14431:10"/>they layed aſide their priuate and particular enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and appeared againſt their common enemy with one accord. Wherefore ſhould not we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians alſo vſe the ſame wiſedome; when we may with a good conſcience doe it ſo, that we may doe it well?</p>
            <p>For concerning the Ceremonies, there hath euer beene a difference in the Church of God, and yet the ancient Fathers neuer condemned one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for it. Neither is it the will of God that men ſhould condemne each other for ſuch outward things.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.7. Hoſ. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>I haue pleaſure in mercie</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and not in offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">Anno. 1556. at Franckfort.</note> 
               <hi>the Proteſtant eſtates haue long ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in agreed, that concerning Ceremonies, when they agree with the word of God,</hi> (as the Wittenbergers, Darm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatters, and Gieſſers confeſſe themſelues that our Ceremonies doe,) <hi>that no State ſhould burthen, vexe, or damnifie another, or falſely accuſe them, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any of theirs to doe ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the doctrine thereabouts, <hi>Paul</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this rule, that if men be agreed in the grounds of ſaluation, then ſhould no man be condemned for by faylings, becauſe God will not condemne ſuch people, and therefore alſo ſhould not they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the one the other. The words of <hi>Paul</hi> are theſe, <hi>Another foundation can no man lay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.11.12.13.14.15.</note> 
               <hi>then that which is layd, which is Ieſus Chriſt. And if any man build on this foundation gold, ſiluer, pretious ſtones, timber, hay, or ſtubble, euery mans worke ſhal be made manifeſt, for, the day will declare it, becauſe it ſhall be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14431:11"/>reuealed by the fire: and the fire ſhall try euery mans worke of what ſort it is. If any mans worke that he hath built vpon abide, he ſhall receiue wages. If any mans worke burne, he ſhall looſe, but he ſhall be ſafe himſelfe, neuertheleſſe, yet as it were by the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See, louing brethren, <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth plainely, when one houldeth the grounds of ſaluation, though he alwayes build not vpon the ſame ground gold and ſiluer, but alſo ſome wood, and ſtubble, yet ſhall he not therfore be damned, but be ſaued, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing of euery man be acknowledged for a child of God.</p>
            <p>Now doe we hold the foundation of ſaluation on both ſides without back-ſliding,<note place="margin">On the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> for the foundation of ſaluation, ſayth <hi>Paul,</hi> is Chriſt Ieſus, wherein we agree on both ſides in one manner, for, we beleeue on both ſides, that he is the euerlaſting Sonne of God, which at the appointed time tooke vpon him the nature of man, and ſo at preſent is both God and man, and ſo ſhall remaine euerlaſtingly in one onely and vnſeparable perſon, yet ſo, that the two natures that are in him, namely, the God-head, and the man-hood, with their naturall properties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnmingled euerlaſtingly, and neither nature is changed into the other, for elſe could he not be true God and man, when he had not in himſelfe as well the godly, as the humaine, and as well the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as the diuine nature, which can no waies be made knowne one from the other, but by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall properties. Alſo, we beleeue on both ſides, that he in his naturall body which he tooke vpon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14431:11"/>him, ſuffered death for vs, and aroſe againe the third day from the dead, and aſcended into heauen forty dayes after his reſurrection, and at this preſent ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the right hand of God, from whence he ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the dead: alſo, that in the meane time, he cauſeth to be preached repentance, and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and that all that beleeue ſuch preaching, and repent them, ſhal not be loſt, but haue euerlaſting life, that is indeed on both ſides our faith. And ſo we doe both of vs hould the foundation of ſaluation without back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then ſhould we not with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience keepe brotherſhip one with another, and in all that may befall vs, hould together as brethren. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that we may not onely doe it with good conſcience, but we are bound alſo to doe it, for he that houldeth the foundation of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I haue laid, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> the ſame, though he haue ſome wood and ſtubble in his doctrine, which in time muſt be burnt with fire, yet ſhall he be ſaued.</p>
            <p>Shall he be ſaued? then muſt he be a childe of God. Is he a childe of God? then muſt he alſo be my brother, or elſe am I no childe of God. Is he my brother? then ſtands it not alone free for mee to performe brotherly truth and loue vnto him, but I am euery way indebted to him therein.</p>
            <p>It is very true, there are ſome contentious ones that ſay, that we haue not onely wood, hay, and ſtubble in our doctrine, but that wee alſo erre in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14431:12"/>thoſe points, that concerne the foundation of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: as namely of the perſon of Chriſt, and of the holy ſupper: but eſpecially about the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting foreknowledge of God, or of free election by grace. For of theſe laſt points, ſay they, giue we ſuch fearefull reaſons; that no Chriſtian can with good conſcience acknowledge vs for children of God, and is able to hould any brotherhood with vs.</p>
            <p>But if we be innocent in this one point, then are we certainly without blame in theſe points, for we beleeue and teach no otherwiſe of theſe points: then as next the holy ſcriptures, happie D. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> himſelfe beleeued and taught euen vnto the day of his death.</p>
            <p>The ſumme whereof is to this effect:<note place="margin">Of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God.</note> that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is ſo corrupted through the fall, that hee is neuer able to beleeue in Chriſt, or to come vnto him by his owne power; though hee be called to him by the Goſpell: But that hee may vnderſtand and receiue the Goſpell of Chriſt, God together with the outward preaching of the Goſpell muſt alſo inwardly open his vnderſtanding, and turne his heart to Chriſt by his holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And ſo is faith nothing leſſe then a worke of free<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>will: but a meere free gift of God, which gift no man hath deſerued of God: It ſo being that al men are ſinners. But God giues ſuch grace freely by grace to whom he will. But thoſe whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently will, thoſe hath he willed from euerlaſting: according to the ſaying of <hi>Iames.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 15.18.</note> 
               <hi>From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14431:12"/>of the world God knoweth all his works.</hi> Therfore floweth faith from this ſpring, euen the euerlaſting foreknowledge of God. And the faithfull haue no cauſe to aſcribe it to themſelues, but to praiſe God, that they do beleeue. The vnbeleeuers alſo cannot aſcribe the fault to God, but to themſelues that they doe not beleeue. For though all men are ſo corrupted by nature that they cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beleeue in Chriſt: yet hath not God ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted them: but they haue ſo corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſeeing that through the diuells prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fell willingly from God. About which fall no man hath cauſe to complaine againſt God, though he ſhould leaue all men in their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vnbeleefe together. And therefore that he doth helpe only ſome out of the ſame, for that they are to magnifie his mercy, and not to diſpute with him about the reſt.</p>
            <p>But when as one deſireth to know whether God hath foreſeene, and choſen him to euerlaſting life, or not: Then ſhall he not ſearch into the ſecret councel of God: for ſuch a ſearching is but in vain; &amp; tendeth to no other end, then to ſerue to bring one another to deſpaire, or indeed vnto fleſhly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But when one deſireth to be aſſured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be ordained to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or no, let him hold himſelfe to the reuealed word of God: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the command thereof beleeue in Chriſt, &amp; repent. And then need he not further ſearch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be elected to life euerlaſting or not, for all they that beleeue in Chriſt without hypocriſie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14431:13"/>are <hi>choſen to life euerlaſting, as it is written, All that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo and no otherwiſe hath D. <hi>Luther</hi> conſtantly taught continually of the euerlaſting foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</p>
            <p>As is to bee ſeene in all his writings, which hee put forth from yeare to yeare, which writings, he that hath them not, or cannot read them: let him read onely the abſtract taken out of them, and was printed certaine yeares agone at Amberge vnder this title:<note place="margin">Anno. 1598.</note> 
               <hi>The Conſtant doctrine of D. Martin Luther of the firſt mouing cauſes of faith.</hi> Or hee that cannot get that abſtract, let him read onely the Preface of D. <hi>Luther</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the Romanes: in his Dutch Bible: which he ouerſaw a new, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee printed the laſt yeare before his death, there may he cleerely finde it. And if hee haue an vpright heart in him, muſt acknowledge that D. <hi>Luther</hi> neuer beleeued and taught otherwaies, then as is aboue mentioned, we therin beleeue and teach.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer fearefull reaſons are obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, aboue and againſt ſuch a doctrine, they are nothing elſe then bare forges deuiſed by peace hating people thereby to diſcredit vs.</p>
            <p>And it skills not much that they note the books and leaues, wherein ſuch fearefull reaſons ſtand. When one is a mans enemy, eaſily may he finde ſomthing in his arguments &amp; writings, which hee may haue ſhew to make an euill conſtruction of.</p>
            <p>When Iulian the Apoſtata, was enemie to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14431:13"/>Chriſtians he accuſed them that they would haue Magriſtacy ceaſe, and would caſt all good order on an heap: for they taught that men ſhould not any more puniſh theeues and Murtherers: but let euery man fulfill his owne euill deſires: and to ſhew them to be ſuch, he repeats Chriſts words: <hi>You haue heard what is ſaid, eye for eye, &amp; tooth for tooth but, I ſay vnto you, that you ſhall not reſiſt euill.</hi> What could be more manifeſtly in ſhew ſaid and laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and yet neuertheleſſe they ſuffered wrong. Euen ſo in truth are we alſo wronged, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men broach ſuch feareful &amp; odious matters of vs. which a man cannot eaſily vtter without ſinning:</p>
            <p>For example they ſay of vs that wee teach that God is the cauſe of ſinne, and hath a delight and pleaſure in ſin, and helpeth to ſin, but God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whom no man can deceiue, that ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God neuer entred into our minds. The contentious would wring it out of this, that ſome of ours write, that there befalleth nothing without the foreknowledge, councell and will of God, no not ſinne it ſelfe. Now it is certaine; our men write thus: that there can nothing be done, without the foreknowledge, councell, and will of God, whether it be little or great, bad or good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen or on earth. But they doe not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, that God is the cauſe of ſinne, or hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure in ſinne, and helpeth therein. But they teach in all their writings the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that God is not the author of ſinne, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee hath no delight and pleaſure in ſinne, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14431:14"/>that he helpeth no man to ſinne, or doth either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly or openly prouoke them to it.</p>
            <p>But whereas indeede they doe write that there comes nothing to paſſe without the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, councell &amp; will of God, yea alſo that which in it ſelfe is euill, and ſinne. That vnderſtand they thus &amp; not otherwaies, as <hi>Luke</hi> vnderſtands it, where he writes of the feareful and great ſinne, which <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> committed againſt Chriſt:<note place="margin">Act. 4.27.28.</note> 
               <hi>doing whatſoeuer the hand and councel of God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined before to be done.</hi> More cleerely, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it thus: That God is an almighty God, and ſo can hinder all things which he will not ſuffer to come to paſſe, and that therefore alſo the euil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and men can performe nothing, when as God hath not determined it, or as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith: when that God in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel had not determin'd that it ſhold come ſo to paſſe: that &amp; no otherwiſe is the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our teachers of the foreknowledge of God, &amp; it is in very truth a right comfortable opinion, for wo vnto vs poore folke, if the Lord were not ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that he before knew all our enemies bad intents, and could let them paſſe, or hinder them according to his councell and will? How long would the Diuell, Pope, and Popiſh confederates ſuffer vs to liue when that God by his prouidence did not gouerne them, and bridled them?</p>
            <p>Euen ſo do we beleeue of the foreknowledge of God, and are aſſured that no Chriſtian man doth beleeue any otherwiſe thereof, yet will they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people that wee beleeue and ſay more
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14431:14"/>haynouſly of the foreknowledge of God: then the Iewes, Turkes, and Heathens.</p>
            <p>We will ſhew one example more, out of which ſuch as feare God, vnderſtanding and impartiall men may ſee how hetherto they haue delt with vs. Wee ſay it is not poſſible that the elect ſhould periſh, which they conſtrue vpon vs, as if we had ſaid and written: he that is elected muſt be ſaued, doe what he will. And on the contrary, he that is not elected muſt bee damned, though hee liue ſo honeſtly and holily, as he can poſſibly. But we te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie before God, and before Chriſt Ieſus, who is to come againe to Iudge the quicke and the dead, that ſuch an opinion neuer came into our minde, we ſay indeed that the elect cannot bee loſt. And why ſhould we not ſay ſo? Chriſt ſaith it himſelfe. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Chapt. And D. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith ſo alſo in innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable many places. But that we ſhould ſay that the elect cannot periſh, with this addition <hi>doe they what they will:</hi> that will neuer bee ſhewed in our writings. But that is our opinion, and for that we ſay, that the elect cannot periſh,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.5. Luke 22.32.</note> becauſe God kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth them by his power in faith to ſaluation: and though they ſometimes fall, yet they lye not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but he raiſeth them againe by repentance, for whom God hath elected to euerlaſting life, thoſe hath he not otherwaies elected,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.4.5. Rom. 8.30. Ezek. 36.27.</note> then with this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he would giue them faith in Chriſt, and that by his holy ſpirit hee would make them new creatures, and ſuch people as ſhould walke in his commandements, Therefore are they no elect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14431:15"/>that doe what they will, but onely they that haue a harty purpoſe, and an earneſt intent to do what God will, that is our opinion herein.</p>
            <p>Concerning the perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Of the perſon of Chriſt.</note> thereof doe wee beleeue no otherwaies, then the other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches vniformely doe beleeue, namely that Chriſt is true God and man, in one vnſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon.</p>
            <p>That is the common conſent of ours, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtant Churches alſo. But that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt ſhould bee euery where: that is the priuate opinion of ſome few contentious ones, whom not onely many Lutherans Churches, as Brunſwick, Pomern, Holſt, Marke, and Denmark ſpeake againſt, but alſo moſt of their owne audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry giue no, credit vnto it: as a man may perceiue if he come into conference with them.</p>
            <p>Setting then aſide this priuate opinion of ſome few contentious ones, about the vbiquity of the body of Chriſt: wee are not inferiour in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the perſon of Chriſt, as alſo of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting foreknowledge of God, to the other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches: And to D. <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe in all things,<note place="margin">Of the holy ſupper.</note> and in all points agreeable. And ſo there remaineth no more beſides, wherein there is any difference betwixt vs, and D. <hi>Luther,</hi> then alone that point of the holy ſupper. And yet differ wee not in the whole point, but onely the leaſt part thereof is in controuerſie.<note place="margin">D. Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſtie: de anno 1529. in the winter part fol. 102. b.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The principall part in the holy ſupper, is the ſpirituall eating and drinking of the body and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14431:15"/>blood of Chriſt, which onely maketh a man right and bleſſed before God, the bodily eating and drinking, is but a token, that maketh no man right and bleſſed before God: <hi>Euen as the horſe can neuer be ſatisfied with painted oates:</hi> ſaith D. <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, we in euery thing agree with D. <hi>Luther,</hi> in the ſpirituall eating and drinking of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: and we beleeue as well as he, that it is done by faith: <hi>When one feedeth himſelfe with the comfortable promiſe of God, that hee gaue his ſonne to death for him, and for his ſake will beſtow vpon him euerlaſting life, through which faith a man is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corporated into Chriſt, that he is, as it were, one bread and one meate with him,</hi> as D. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>Whilſt, wee then on both ſides agree in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eating and drinking of the body and blood of Chriſt: wherefore will we ſeuer our ſelues, and condemne each other for the ſignes ſake, by which the ſpirituall eating and drinking, is repreſented. Doc. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith: the tokens in the holy ſupper, which men eate &amp; drinke with the bodily mouth, are not onely bread and wine, but alſo the body, and the blood of Chriſt, preſent in the bread and wine, vnſeene.</p>
            <p>We ſay, the body and blood of Chriſt, are not the tokens: but the betokened heauenly riches: which cannot be laid hould on, neither fed on by the bodily mouth, but onely by faith. But the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens which we ſhall, and can eate, and drinke in the ſupper with our bodily mouthes, we ſay, are bread and wine, ordained of Chriſt, to this holie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14431:16"/>vſe, that through ſuch bodily eating of tokens, the ſpirituall bliſſe, making, feeding, by the betokened heauenly riches (Namely the true body &amp; blood of Chriſt, which is performed by faith) are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, confirmed, and ſealed.</p>
            <p>And ſo, in no manner of waies doe wee teach, that men doe eate and drinke onely bare bread and wine in the ſupper, as the contentious falſely accuſe vs: but wee doe teach that men eate and drinke in the ſupper, both bread and wine: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the true body and blood of Chriſt: but with this difference, that men eate and drinke the bread and wine with the bodily mouth: but the bodie and blood of Chriſt with the ſpirituall mouth: namely by faith, by which onely a man can bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly take hould on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore there is no ſtrife betwixt. D. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and vs, whether we eate and drinke the true body and true blood of Chriſt in the ſupper: but there is the difference: how we eate and drinke the true bodie, and true blood of Chriſt in the ſupper.</p>
            <p>We ſay, we eate and drinke the true bodie and true blood of Chriſt in the ſupper onely ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith.</p>
            <p>D. <hi>Luther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tom. 1. fol. 208. Tom. 2. fol 197. tom 3. fol. 487.</note> ſaith: wee doe not onely eate and drinke the true body and blood of Chriſt in the ſupper, ſpiritually, by faith: but alſo bodily with the mouth.</p>
            <p>That cannot wee beleeue. Not that we would not gladly beleeue the word of God, but becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14431:16"/>wee cannot finde in our iudgements,<note place="margin">The body of Chriſt is eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the mouth of the faithfull &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, as well of Iudas as of Peter.</note> that that is Gods word, that wee ſhould eate and drinke the bodie and blood of Chriſt, with our bodilie mouthes.</p>
            <p>D. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith: Chriſt hath ſaid it, in that hee tooke the bread and ſaid: <hi>Take, eate, this is my body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now dowe gladly beleeue the words of Chriſt, but that the words of Chriſt ſhould haue ſuch an vnderſtanding, as D. <hi>Luther</hi> giues them, as if he had ſaid, namely. <hi>In, or vnder the bread, is my body vnſeene, and yet really together with it. And therefore when you eate the bread with your mouthes, ſo doe you therewith eate my body alſo with your mouthes, it being in or vnder the bread hidden.</hi> That that ſhould be the meaning of Chriſt, that cannot we beleeue.</p>
            <p>For ſuch a conſtruction runneth againſt the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian faith, and the whole holy Scripture, therein being plainely teſtified, that Chriſt hath but one body, wherewith he ſat at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their open ſightes, at the time of the firſt ſupper. And wherewith hee alſo in open ſight aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into heauen, fortie daies after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: but not much the better if hee hath one body at preſent ſeene in heauen, and an other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene on earth, in euery hoſt one.</p>
            <p>But we vnderſtand, that this is the meaning of Chriſt, when he tooke the bread and ſpake: <hi>This is my body, which is giuen for you:</hi> as if he had ſaid, that ſhall bee vnto you a remembrance of my body, which I haue giuen for you to death, that ſo I as the right heauenly bread may feede you to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14431:17"/>life, or which is to one effect, that ſo I may deliuer you from the euerlaſting hunger and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which elſe you muſt haue ſuffered in hell.</p>
            <p>We vnderſtand, that that was the meaning of Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you:</hi> Whileſt he preſently after ſaith, <hi>doe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> and whileſt in al Sacraments God vſed ſo to ſpeake, he naming the tokens euen ſo, as if they were the betokened treaſures themſelues. For example, when he ordained circumciſion: he ſaid:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10. Gen. 17.11. Rom. 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>This is my couenant,</hi> yet was it not otherwiſe ment, then if he had ſaid: <hi>This is a token or ſeale of my couenant:</hi> euen as preſently God himſelfe declared, where he for the words: this is my couenant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vſeth theſe words: It ſhall bee a ſigne of the couenant betwixt me and thee.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Eaſter lamb is called of God the <hi>Paſcha,</hi> which is in dutch as much as Paſſeouer,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.27. Exod. 12.17. Exod. 13.16.</note> when hee made his deuouring Angell paſſe by the houſes of the children of Iſraell. And yet it was not meant by it, as if the Eaſter lambe were the Paſſeouer it ſelfe, but that it ſhould bee a token and a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Paſſeouer, as the Lord againe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe declared where he ſaid: <hi>This ſhall bee a token to thee in thy hands, and a remembrance before thine eies.</hi> Euen ſo doe wee vnderſtand that alſo in this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely in the holy Supper, Chriſt ſpake Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, and ſo ſaid firſt: <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you,</hi> and after added, <hi>doe ſuch in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me:</hi> thereby demonſtrating, that hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bread his crucified body for vs; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14431:17"/>hee ordained it in remembrance, or for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeale, or pledge of his crucified body for vs.</p>
            <p>In which opinion that confirmeth vs alſo,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> which wee finde in the holy Scripture, that Chriſt moſt flatly againe and againe caſteth away the bodily eating and drinking of his body and blood. With theſe two grounds: firſt,<note place="margin">Verſ. 61.62.</note> that hee would aſcend to heauen, where wee could not ſeaſe on him or eate him, with our bodily mouths. Secondly, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,<note place="margin">Verſ. 33.63.</note> ſuch a bodily eating &amp; drinking of his body and bloud was not profitable vnto ſaluation. But rather who ſo doth eat and drinke him ſpiritually, or as hee had preſently ſaid before, he that commeth to him and beleeueth in him, he ſhal haue euerlaſting life, and he will raiſe him vp at the laſt day.</p>
            <p>Whilſt now Chriſt hath againe and againe caſt away expreſly the bodily eating, and drinking of his body and blood: therefore cannot wee beleeue, that hee would ordaine againſt himſelfe, a bodily eating and drinking of his body and blood in the Supper.</p>
            <p>Thoſe bee our grounds, which mooue vs to hold that the words of Chriſt, This is my bodie, are not ſo to bee vnderſtood, as if the body of Chriſt were really there preſent hidden in the bread: (as they ſing: <hi>hidden in the bread ſo little</hi>) but that the bread &amp; the ſame food ſhould be a remembrance or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs in minde of the body of Chriſt, which hee gaue vp to death on the croſſe for vs, as Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently himſelfe hath cleared and ſaid, <hi>Doe this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me:</hi> that is, take this bread, and eat it,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14431:18"/>in remembrance that I as the true heauenly breade gaue vp my body for you euen to death on the croſſe, and haue ſpilt my bloud, for the forgiuenes of your ſinnes, and ſhall be vnto you a true meat &amp; drinke to euerlaſting life, which meat and drinke neuertheleſſe, you muſt eat by true faith, and let ſlip into your hearts, that it may comfort, waſh &amp; quicken your ſelues, both in life and death.</p>
            <p>Admit now that we did erre, with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ours: yet did not ſuch an error, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the grounds of ſaluation: for Saluation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not in the bodily eating, and drinking of the body and blood of Chriſt: but ſaluation ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the ſpirituall eating and drinking of the body and blood of Chriſt: as D. <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſeth himſelfe, therefore and if indeede we did erre, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bodily eating and drinking of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: yet neuertheleſſe did we not ouerthrow the ground of ſaluation with ſuch an error.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they haue no ſufficient and vrgent cauſe, for this points ſake (namely, for ſo much as concerneth the holy ſupper) wherefore they ſhould condemne vs as heathens, and with ſuch condemning any longer hinder the highly neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full agreement of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
            <p>Intruth it were well to be wiſhed,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.16. Rom. 15.5. 1. Cor. 1.10.</note> that we were all of one mind, and vſed one forme of reaſoning, euen all of vs together of all and euery point of Chriſtian Religion: as alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places moſt truely admoniſheth vs therunto.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:14431:18"/>
            <p> But it is vnpoſſible that wee can euer bring it perfectly to that paſſe in this life.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.</note> 
               <hi>For we know but in part:</hi> and God giueth alwaies more light in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall matters to one then to another: as a man may notably ſee in the writings of the old fathers, whereof not anie of them agreede in all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>If then wee ſhall not loue one another before, and as brethren hould together till ſuch time as we haue one vnderſtanding, and meaning altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all godly matters, then ſhall wee neuer in this life loue one another, and hould together as brethren.</p>
            <p>Now then this is the very Pith of the whole Chriſtian Religion, that we doe out of a pure hart and a good conſcience, and faith vnfained, firſt loue God, who gaue his ſonne to death, for vs, and then alſo our ſelues, that we loue each other.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> giues vs not onely this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that wee ſhould bee of one minde in all things, and ſhould be diligent to vſe one forme: but he giues vs alſo yet another commaundement to this effect, that though there were ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence found in vs about the vnderſtanding of godly matters, we ſhould not breake the bond of loue, and part the vnity of the ſpirit, but beare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the one with the others ignorance and weakeneſſe. <hi>Paules</hi> words are theſe.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.15.16.</note> 
               <hi>Let vs therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded, and if yee be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God ſhall reueale euen the ſame vnto you, Neuertheleſſe, in that whereunto we are come, let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14431:19"/>by one rule, that we may minde one thing.</hi> That is the commaundement of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we ſeperate not our ſelues for one point, or other, but giue place to God (whoſoeuer he bee that at the preſent houlds any vnfit thing) to make it more knowne vnto him in his time; And in the meane time walke peaceably, as is ſaide accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common rule or ground of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wherein by the grace of God we do agree.</p>
            <p>This command of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> louing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, wee intreate you to conſider and to begin from this time forth to liue brotherly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with vs.</p>
            <p>We do not deſire, that you ſhould for our ſakes be ſilent in any thing you hold to be truth, or not to confute our grounds if you can do it.</p>
            <p>But onely this is our deſire, that you would for thoſe errors ſake, which we hould (in your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) of the holy ſupper, not ſo ſhamefully raile vpon, vs and condemne vs, in your ſermons and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. When you ſhall but doe ſo, then is the peace readily accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>For we deſire not to condemne you. But when you liue godlily, according to the knowledge which God hath giuen vnto you, then hould wee you for children of God, &amp; for brethren in Chriſt Ieſus, for all the errors which wee are perſwaded that you haue about the holy ſupper.</p>
            <p>And therefore it reſteth in you louing brethren, you can helpe the Churches of God, if you ſo pleaſe. And there is iuſt cauſe why you ſhould
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14431:19"/>pleaſe: being it is ſo Gods pleaſure: and alſo our great neceſſitie requires it, for it is vnpoſſible that ours (namely the Proteſtant Churches) ſhould be able long to ſtand, if we do not quickly make peace one with another, and lay downe the vnhappie contention that hetherto hath beene betwixt vs.</p>
            <p>For by ſuch ſtrife, doe we make our ſelues naked of all armor, which wee ſhould haue both from God and man againſt the Pope.<note place="margin">Pſal. 133.</note> It ſo being that God will not aſſiſt the contentious, but if wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and call vpon him with an humble ſpirit, then will he beſtow vpon vs his grace, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>And indeede the power of the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States, is alſo not ſufficient to counteruaile the Popedomes, if they ſeuer themſelues into two or three ſides, and the one part ſhall helpe to rippe vp the other.</p>
            <p>As touching the common man, he vnderſtands almoſt nothing any more now of the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Popedome, for that he heares almoſt nothing elſe from the Pulpet but onely railings vpon the Caluiniſts, yea he heares that (according to their teachers ſuggeſtions) the Papiſts are not by much ſo bad, as the Caluiniſts, and therefore is it not poſſible that in the time of neceſſity, hee ſhould haue a ſound zeale to fight againſt the Popedome, but in time he will hould as much of one Religion as of another.</p>
            <p>And grant it, that we ſhould neuer be bodily ſet vpon by the Papiſts, yet are we at this very preſent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14431:20"/>ſo ſet vpon by them ſpiritually as neuer before the like. The Ieſuites plot ſubtilely day and night, how they may make their bad cauſe good, with ſerpent-like writings, and on the contrary ſide, bring our good cauſe into all euill ſuſpicion, not onely to the common man: but alſo, and that moſt eſpecially, to all great Princes.</p>
            <p>We in the meane time are together by the eares and the youth of the Proteſtants ſtudy almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but how the Lutherans may match with the Caluiniſts, and the Caluiniſts with the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans: that is, God be mercifull vnto vs, almoſt all the diuinity in our times of the Proteſtants and ſhould not a man alſo find a great number amongſt the Preachers, who doe not well and groundedlie know whereon dependeth the certaine grounds of ſtrife betwixt vs and the Papiſts: and wherfore our forefathers did ſeparate themſelues from them, or what grounds they maintained againſt them.</p>
            <p>To what manner of end theſe things will at laſt reach vnto, we intreat all vnderſtanding people to conſider. And when yet they will not thinke vpon it, who ought moſt of all to thinke vpon it, then the Lord God grant that the Princes and Lords toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their peacelouing councells, may for that end once open their owne eies: It is high time, and if it come not to paſſe ſpeedily: then will the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe which the Pope hath intended againſt vs, moſt aſſuredly not long be kept out from vs.</p>
            <p>The God of Peace, who hath euer hetherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Church into his fatherly protection, hee bee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14431:20"/>pleaſed furthermore alſo to take pitty vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame: and to ſtirre vp godly people, who may rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and take to hart what that is that Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.5.</note> happy are the peacemakers for they ſhall be called the children of God.</p>
            <p>To the almighty true God and Father, together with the ſonne and holy Ghoſt, the onely and alone true God: be thanks, honour, and praiſe, both now, and for euermore: Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Octor</hi> Lucas Oſiander <hi>publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a booke at Tubingen, vnder this title:</hi> Warning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Ieſuits bad practiſes, &amp; bloodthirſty plots, &amp;c. <hi>In the which booke (euen from the Ieſuites owne pictures &amp; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) hee manifeſtly noteth and teſtifieth, that the Ieſuites together with the Popes confederates haue wholly concluded, that they will no more diſpute with vs out of the word of God, but would conſume and deſtroy all thoſe with fire and ſword, by the helpe of the worldly potentates, who were fallen from the Pope. And that they are determined to put in practiſe, ſuch their bloud thirſty plots, and bad practiſes, ſo ſoon as may poſſibly be brought to paſſe, &amp; that moſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14431:22"/>eſpecially in our beloued fatherland the Dutch Nation.</hi> In the ſame booke are two things moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be marked, the one is, that the Papiſts are euen as great enemies to the Lutherans, as to the Caluiniſts, <hi>and deſire to conſume and deſtroy the one ſide as wel as the other: the other is; That the religious peace would nothing at all ſtay the Papiſts from their intents: when they can but come to practiſe them.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pap. 5.</hi> Although Satan be a thouſand fold more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpirit, and much more ſecret and crafty together with the children of this world in their practiſes, then the children of light in their buſineſse: yet for all that, our Lord God oftentimes ſo blindeth Satan, that he cannot in all things bee ſecret and cloſe in the wickednes which hee goeth about, but hee tickleth himſelfe ſo with his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded practiſes, that men of vnderſtanding can marke, yea and as it were, lay hold on what he hath in his mind. Euen ſo hath Satan in the abouenamed paintings of his truſtie beloued, the Ieſuites, ſo let his ſharpe clawes peepe out that a man may gripe how they haue hitherto practiſed, that the higheſt and chiefeſt Potentates in Chriſtendome (if they would follow their mindes) might fall vpon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall Proteſtant States of the Augsburges Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diſtroy them and conſume the faith of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall profeſsors: for it is manifeſt by the counſel of Trent (in the which our Chriſtian Euangelicall Religion is moſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14431:22"/>vnreaſonably railed on, and condemned for heriſie) and in like manner, out of the manifould poiſenous writings of the Ieſuites, which they haue theſe diuers yeares pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt the ſound Doctrine of the Agusburges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, what people they hould for heritickes, and for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Chriſtian Churches (in their opinion) which (in their mindes) as wilde beaſts ſhould deſtroy the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Chriſtian Churches: which alſo ſhould bee ſtrangled and diſtroyed (according to the Ieſuites deſires) by great and high intituled Potentates.</p>
            <p>And the Ieſuites vnderſtand by the ſame beaſts,<note place="margin">The Ieſuits haue ſworne the death, of the Lutherans as well as the Caluiniſts.</note> not onely thoſe who are fallen from the Romiſh Religion, and yet agree not rightly with the Augſburges confeſſion, but all thoſe who will not haue to doe with the Papiſts Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, miſdoings and Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>And eſpecially thoſe who haue bound themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to the Chriſtian Augsburges confeſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue alſo put vnder the beaſts ſome of thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, which the Proteſtant Princes vſe to beare in their Armes. And when they ſhould get the gace into their owne hands, they would (out of all doubt) hold the one as the other, and deſtroy them all who would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Pope of Rome for the vicar of Chriſt, nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him for their earthly God. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alſo Pag. <hi>10.</hi> If the Ieſuites had but one drop of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bloud in them, and one ſparke of the meeke ſpirit of Ieſus, they would not onelie in right not hate vs, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute vs, but loue vs with all their hearts, and in time of neceſsity euen wager their verie liues for vs.</p>
            <p>As Iohn teacheth in his Epiſtle, where he ſaith: wee ſhould euen lay downe our liues for the brethren, therfore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14431:23"/>the Ieſuites haue no reaſonable cauſe to perſecute vs, if they were true Ieſuites, that is, were faithfull Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And though there be here and there ſome Christians,<note place="margin">N. B. The Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts are alſo true Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> (moſt eſpeciallie in France, and the low Countries) who are found, to haue falne from the Pope, and neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe doe not agree with vs in euery article of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, whoſe error we indeed cannot alſo allow of, as being againſt the holy Scripture, yet is not this any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian way or meanes to helpe the Church of God, and to maintaine pure Religion, that the ſame ſhould be deſtroyed with the ſword.</p>
            <p>And the Ieſuites ſhould in all reaſon conſider, that looke how often the ſame Chriſtians defend one Erronious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that they the Ieſuites haue alwaies tenne Erronious Popiſh Articles, which they both beleeue and hold, which yet they ſhall neuer be able to defend to the end of the world: and therefore they might very well carry water with them vpon one coleſtaffe.</p>
            <p>And beſides that, conſider that vnder the aforenamed Chriſtians, there are certaine thouſand ſimple people, who haue neuer bene better inſtructed, &amp; that if they heard of a better religion in their Lands, they looking to it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues would take it in thankfulnes. And ſo there is a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vnder them like to thoſe of whom the Lord ſaid to the Prophet Ionas, that they know not the difference betwixt the right hand or the left.</p>
            <p>And therefore if the Ieſuites had that Chriſtian loue (by which Chriſt willeth, that his diſciples ſhould bee knowne) in their hearts, they would not caſt out the child with the bath, or rend vp the good wheat with the weeds: much leſſe ſo lay their platformes, that the childe ſhould be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14431:23"/>murthered in the mothers bellies, as is manifeſted by their prouocations in France, at Paris, Orliance, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon <hi>Bartholmew</hi> day, Anno. <hi>1574.</hi> &amp;c. practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, where no woman with child was ſpared.</p>
            <p>But the Ieſuites would gladly begin the play with thoſe ſimple Chriſtians, who are not in al things ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">N. B. The Ieſuites would begin with the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts, that ſo they might end it with the Lutherans. M. Lucas Oſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders gloſſe, The Ieſuites eſteeme one Euangeliſt Chriſtian as the other.</note> whereby they might end it, with thoſe who do in euery point hold the pure doctrine of the Augsburges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. For the Ieſuites eſteeme the one as they doe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who will not make himſelfe partaker of their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, iugling and falſe Romiſh Religion, hee is adiudged of them to death.</p>
            <p>Theſe Chriſtians which faile, men ought to informe out of the word of God, and make them to vnderſtand better the truth, but for the cauſe of Religion (which they doe neuertheleſſe maintaine quietly and reaſonably) ſhould they not be put to death.</p>
            <p>Alſo page. <hi>14.</hi> If we had no better teſtimony againſt the Romiſh Antichriſt the Pope, that hee is from his Father the Diuell, yet were it ſufficiently witneſſed by this, that he hath in the cauſe of Religion ſtirred vp ſo much ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood: and yet at this preſent day doth moſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouoke and deſire to driue on the Potentates thereto, that they might ſtaine their hands in the innocent bloud of honeſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And to effect this,<note place="margin">The Ieſuites care for no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious peace.</note> hee vſeth his Scoutwatches (the Diuels poſts) the Ieſuites, who vnder the ſhew of great holineſſe poſſeſſe the hearts of many people, and deſire to bring the matter to that paſſe, that a fearefull cutting of throats, and butchery might be ſet abroach in Dutchland, and other kingdomes, the peace of Religion be broken, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14431:24"/>that the ſtronger ſhould put the weaker in the ſacke.</p>
            <p>In like manner alſo, before this time, one that thought himſelfe a Lawyer, but a bad and falſe Chriſtian, Doctor George Eder mocked the Religious peace in manifeſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting put in print, and drue the ſame onely to a toleration, which neither could nor ſhould be of force.</p>
            <p>Such folke hath the ſubtill Diuell kept till the laſt ende of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> game, and made his cards of helps, that through them he might ſet a worke miſery and neceſsity.</p>
            <p>And therfore whileſt there is not onely ſo much to be gathered out of the abouenamed pictures of the Ieſuites, but alſo out of their writings, practiſes, and plots, that their intent and purpoſe reacheth to that end, to deſtroie the Proteſtant Religion and Eſtates: By this it is manifeſt that the murthering ſpirit, namely the Diuellrideth them, and will not let them keepe holy day, till that they (when the Lord ſhall tolerate them) haue ſet a worke a fearefull bloodbath. Therefore is it much better to hould nothing, then to be ſuch people, who deſire to ouerthrow the peace of Religion, and alſo the worldly peace, and to be ſet a worke, to the furthering of Miſery and neceſsity.</p>
